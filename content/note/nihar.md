I am Nihar Samantaray, a developer from India.
I enjoy turning complex codes and projects into simple and modular ones.
By day, I am a System Engineer at Edgeverve where we build modern banking applications. By night, I am an open-source developer.

* I can code in Rust, Nim, Haskell, C, Javascript, Java, Bash, Python.
* Prefers CLI workflow. VIM over VSCode any-day, anytime.

I am open to help if you need some kind of expertise I have.
If so, you can mail me. ( [mail@nihars.com](mailto:mail@nihars.com) )  


Also, I am a big fan of manga and [anime](/anime).

I don't use these social networks as much as I use Mastodon, but still, if you want to connect, feel free.
