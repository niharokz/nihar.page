The philosophy I am trying to follow: "Use it when you need it!" 

This website does not need any javascript or CSS class. Even this site don't need div tag. In other words, I keep this as minimalist as possible. 

Earlier I used to spent eternity redesigning this website. It is just like decorating your house. But with time I realized that it is not worth the time and resources. It was making this website slower and thicker. 

Now I want to keep everything simple and fast. I have followed the below step to improve this site :

* [Pidgeotto](https://pypi.org/project/pidgeotto/) to generate webpage.
* Nginx webserver in Google cloud.
* No javascript. No CSS Class. No unnecessary tags.
* Webp or SVG image format. And sometimes jpg.
* Configured Nginx for leverage caching.
* Validated syntax via w3 org.
* Cloudflare as CDN. If any better alternative, please suggest?
* Single no class CSS file.
* HTML5 syntax over basic html.
* No use of google fonts.

Apart from that, keeping pagespeed insight value to 100 feels good. Another tool I used to measure page performance is Gtmetrix. Currently, I am satisfied with the looks and feel of this website. 

Any suggestions or recommendations are most welcome!
